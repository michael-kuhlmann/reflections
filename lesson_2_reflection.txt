Reflection on Lesson 2:

What I learned:
- ls -a to show hidden files (beginning with a .), too
- "git init" to change a normal directory into a git repository
- "git status" to show the status of the repository (most recent commit, tracked files)

Question 1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Reflection: When you initialize a repository Git will create a .git file where it will save the history for all the files in the repository to keep track of them and allow version control to work.

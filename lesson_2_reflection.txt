Reflection on Lesson 2:

What I learned:
- ls -a to show hidden files (beginning with a .), too
- "git init" to change a normal directory into a git repository
- "git status" to show the status of the repository (most recent commit, tracked files)

Question 1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Reflection: When you initialize a repository Git will create a .git file where it will save the history for all the files in the repository to keep track of them and allow version control to work.

What I learned: 
- Git has a staging area between working directory and repository so you can decide what to commit
- You can add files with "git add" to the staging area to keep track of them
- "git reset" to remove tracked files from the staging area

Question 2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Reflection: You can not see the files in the staging area physically. It is a virtual space that contains files you want to track. You have the chance to decide which files should be in the staging area: When you create a file in your working directory it will be in it and when you do a commit all files that should be tracked are saved in the repository. So the staging area allows you to control the files that should be keep track of.
